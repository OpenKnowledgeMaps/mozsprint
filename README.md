# Welcome to Open Knowledge Maps

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Open Knowledge Maps :tada:! 

## Project overview

Our goal is to revolutionize discovery of scientific knowledge. We are building a visual interface that dramatically increases the visibility of research findings for science and society alike. We believe that a better way to explore and discover scientific knowledge will benefit us all.

We have been developing the system as [a group of volunteers](https://openknowledgemaps.org/team] and have released the results on our website https://openknowledgemaps.org. Currently, users can create a knowledge map for a topic of their choice based on either PubMed or the BASE. Our software retrieves the 100 most relevant results for a topic and creates a knowledge map based on textual similarity between the records. The map is intended to give users a head start in their literature research.

## How you can contribute

There are a number of ways you can contribut during the Mozilla Sprint! 

* Let us know what you think! Try out the system and let us know via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OK_Maps], [our brand new discussion forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/okmaps-discuss) or by [opening a Github issue](https://github.com/OpenKnowledgeMaps/Headstart/issues). If you are in a group, you can also take the [hands-on lesson that we created for the Mozilla Study Groups](https://github.com/OpenKnowledgeMaps/learning-materials/blob/master/mozilla-study-group-lesson.md).
* Help us fix issues! We will be working on a number of issues in our knowledge mapping framework [Headstart](https://openknowledgemaps.org/Headstart) that you can jump in on. They are all marked with the [mozsprint label](https://github.com/OpenKnowledgeMaps/Headstart/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Amozsprint). Good first contributions have an additional label, so look out for that.
